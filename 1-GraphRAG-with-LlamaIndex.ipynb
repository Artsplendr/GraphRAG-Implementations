        "The concept of GraphRAG was first introduced in the research paper titled **“From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization,”** by Darren Edge, Ha Trinh, Newman Cheng, Joshua Bradley, Alex Chao, Apurva Mody, Steven Truitt, Jonathan Larson, published in April 2024.  \n",
        "\n",
        "This paper addresses the limitations of traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems when handling global queries over extensive text corpora. The authors propose a novel approach that integrates large language models (LLMs) with graph-based text indexing to construct an entity knowledge graph from source documents. By generating community summaries for groups of related entities, the system can produce comprehensive and diverse responses to broad, sensemaking questions. Evaluations demonstrate that this Graph RAG method significantly outperforms baseline RAG models in both comprehensiveness and diversity of answers, particularly for large datasets.\n",

(NASDAQ:HSIC) in its first quarter 2023 investor letter:\\n\\\"We continue to evaluate new investment opportunities. Despite the volatility of recent months, we see a number of strong tailwinds in certain sectors \\u2014 particularly those that solve big societal problems. One such problem is growing healthcare costs, which will put more pressure on social-security systems and household budgets. Later in this letter we profile Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC), the largest distributor of dental and medical products and services globally. Companies like Henry Schein have the potential to control the growth in healthcare costs, while promoting access to underserved communities.\\nAt the same time, healthcare cost pressures are escalating. To make matters worse, healthcare has worse labour shortages than most industries, while productivity improvements are hard to come by.4 In almost every country, health spending is forecast to form an increasing share of GDP in the coming years.\\nAt Generation, we look for companies that can provide a solution to these long-term challenges. More specifically, we look for healthcare companies that reduce costs and drive efficiency; that improve clinical outcomes; and that improve access to care. Henry Schein, a long-term holding of your portfolio, is an example of a company that we believe can deliver on all three of these criteria...\\\" (Click here to read the full text)\\nHenry Schein, Inc.
